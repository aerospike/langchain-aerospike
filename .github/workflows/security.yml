# This file has been removed as the checks were redundant with GitHub's built-in security features.
# Security is now handled through:
# - GitHub's built-in security alerts
# - Dependabot for dependency updates
# - Private vulnerability reporting (enabled in repository settings)
# - SECURITY.md file for reporting guidelines
